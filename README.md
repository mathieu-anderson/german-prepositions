## To do

- Use React Hooks to display translations on hover of a specific preposition card (implementation example : https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/src/useHover.ts)
- Hooks implementation of autoscroll to top as well (instead of HOC) ? https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/guides/scroll-restoration.md#scroll-to-top
